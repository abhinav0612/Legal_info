game in which "YOU ARE THE LAWYER " in which we will uplod 100 type of cases 
((People never wants to read any thing they will surely skip the animation part and the reading part)) in story mode  so we will not add that much annimation  we will simply add "MUKESH foud guilty for stealing these things and now he has charges 502 and fined 10000 and 2 year jail " now the game and if once game star tpeople will surely read the instruction and pages so will have 4-6 pages in desk which contains the conclusion of all the laws like for 215 we will write conclusion that from this he will get bail like this and then he has a story mode that what happens how mukesh is here to make the game intresting and then its a type of story which will leaded by people and comes to conclusion  
There will be three section of people 
1 who will enjoy for them its all good lets it be same 
2 who will stay ok ok for them for boys we can add girls assistant and for girl we will add boys assistant who will make fun of his/her and the conversation continue
